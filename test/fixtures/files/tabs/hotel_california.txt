CAPO 2


[Verse]

Am                         E7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
  I had to stop for the night

Am                               E7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G
  And I was thinking to myself
              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
   There were voices down the corridor,
E
  I thought I heard them say...


[Chorus]

F                          C
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                               C
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm                                       E
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here


[Verse]

Am                            E7
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
G                                    D  
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Am                           E7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D  
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
  and still those voices are calling from far away
Dm    
   Wake you up in the middle of the night 
E
  Just to hear them say...


[Chorus]

F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                             C
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Dm                                               E
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis

 
[Verse]
 
Am                        E7
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G                                D  
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm                          
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
E
just can't kill the beast

Am                             E7
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                    D  
  I had find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Dm           
  You can check out any time you like
E
 But you can never leave...
