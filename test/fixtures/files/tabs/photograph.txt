All strums should be muted, but it's not possible to have a strum which is both accented
and muted using the strumming pattern tool.


[Intro]

D   Bm   A   G


[Verse]

           D
Loving can hurt
           Bm
Loving can hurt sometimes
             A                          G 
But it's the only thing that I know
             D
When it gets hard
                    Bm
You know it can get hard sometimes
          A                                 G
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                      G
We keep this love in a photograph
D                       A
We make these memories for ourselves
          Bm           
Where our eyes are never closing
     G
Our hearts were never broken
     D                         A
And times forever frozen still


[Chorus]

           D
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
A
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
Bm                             G
Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
                         D
Wait for me to come home


[Verse]

            D
Loving can heal
           Bm
Loving can mend your soul
             A                         G
And it's the only thing that I know
                    D
I swear it will get easier
                           Bm
remember that with every piece of ya
             A                                   G
It is the only thing we take with us when we die


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                      G
We keep this love in a photograph
D                       A
We make these memories for ourselves
          Bm           
Where our eyes are never closing
     G
Our hearts were never broken
     D                      A
And times forever frozen still


[Chorus]

           D
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
A
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
Bm                               G
Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone


[Bridge]

           D
And if you hurt me that's ok baby, only
A 
Words bleed inside these pages you just
Bm                              G
Hold me and I won't ever let you go


[Interlude]

                     Bm
Wait for me to come home
                     G       
Wait for me to come home
                     D
Wait for me to come home
                     A
Wait for me to come home


[Outro]

           D                               
Oh you can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were
A           
16 next to your heartbeat where I 
Bm                                    G
Should be, keep it deep within your soul
           D
And if you hurt me that's ok baby only 
A 
Words bleed inside these pages you just
Bm                              G
Hold me and I won't ever let you go
          D                 
When I'm away I will remember how you
A                                      Bm
Kissed me under the lamp post back on sixth street 
                                 G
Hearing you whisper through the phone
                     D
Wait for me to come home
