[Verse 1]
Am                         C
  You must think that I'm stupid
G                           Dm
  You must think that I'm a fool
Am                         C
  You must think that I'm new to this
G                            Dm 
  But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
    Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
C
Even though you mean the most to me
       G                        Dm
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
       Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
C
Even when I mean the most to you
   G                               Dm
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Refrain]
               Am                         C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                         C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                       G                           Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                         Am                            C
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                         G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
Am                            C
  I know you're thinking I'm heartless
G                             Dm
  I know you're thinking I'm cold
Am                        C
  I'm just protecting my innocence
G                         Dm
  I'm just protecting my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
    Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
C
Even though you mean the most to me
       G                        Dm
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
       Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
C
Even when I mean the most to you
   G                               Dm
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Refrain]
               Am                        C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                         C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                        G                         Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                         Am                            C
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                         G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                          Am                              C
No way that you'll see me cry (No way that you'll see me cry)
                         G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
Am                                             C
  No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
G                                                      Dm
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
Am                            C
  (No way that you'll see me cry)
G                           Dm
  (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
               Am                        C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                        C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                        G                         Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
N.C.
I'm way too good at goodbyes
