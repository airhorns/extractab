[VERSE]

          G        Em
I found a love for me
             C                            D
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
               G           Em
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
         C                                    D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me


[PRE-CHORUS]

                                 G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
             Em                     C                G  D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
                   G                         Em
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                   D
And in your eyes you’re holding mine


[CHORUS]

      Em   C             G          D              Em
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
          C                G                 D              Em
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D             G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

[VERSE]

               G                    Em
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                C                                        D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I’ll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own


[PRE-CHORUS]

                              G                     Em 
We are still kids, but we’re so in love, fighting against all odds

I know that we’ll be alright this ti-ime
               G                            Em 
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I’ll be your man
          C              D
I see my future in your eyes


[CHORUS]

      Em   C              G         D              Em
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        C                G                D      
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  Em       C                  G        D            G 
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight
