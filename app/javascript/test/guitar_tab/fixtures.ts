CAPO 2


[Verse]

Am                         E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
I had to stop for the night

Am                               E7
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G
And I was thinking to myself
            D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
 There were voices down the corridor,
E
I thought I heard them say...


[Chorus]

F                          C
Welcome to the Hotel California.
     E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
      F                               C
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
  Dm                                       E
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here


[Verse]

Am                            E7
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
G                                    D
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Am                           E7
So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
and still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
 Wake you up in the middle of the night
E
Just to hear them say...


[Chorus]

F                         C
Welcome to the Hotel California.
     E7                                          Am
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
      F                             C
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California

What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis

Am                        E7
 Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)

We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm
They stab it with their steely knives but they
E
just can't kill the beast

Am                             E7
 Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                    D
I had find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
"Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive

Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                    C
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
G                                                 D                             Em

                 G
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    D
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
   Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
     C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
      G
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
 D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
Em
It's what we aim to do.
  C
Our name is our virtue.


[Chorus]

G              D
But I won't hesitate
          Em
No more, No more

It can not wait; I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me,

Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                    C
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
 G
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
      D
There's no need to complicate.
         Em
'Cause our time is short.
                           C
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.

[Verse 1]
Am                         C
You must think that I'm stupid
G                           Dm
You must think that I'm a fool
Am                         C
You must think that I'm new to this
G                            Dm
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
  Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
C
Even though you mean the most to me
     G                        Dm
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
     Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
C
Even when I mean the most to you
 G                               Dm
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Refrain]
             Am                         C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                 G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                 Am                         C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                     G                           Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                       Am                            C
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                       G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
Am                            C
I know you're thinking I'm heartless
G                             Dm
I know you're thinking I'm cold
Am                        C
I'm just protecting my innocence
G                         Dm
I'm just protecting my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
  Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
C
Even though you mean the most to me
     G                        Dm
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
     Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
C
Even when I mean the most to you
 G                               Dm
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Refrain]
             Am                        C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                 G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                 Am                         C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                      G                         Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                       Am                            C
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                       G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                        Am                              C
No way that you'll see me cry (No way that you'll see me cry)
                       G                             Dm
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
Am                                             C
No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
G                                                      Dm
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
Am                            C
(No way that you'll see me cry)
G                           Dm
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
             Am                        C
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                 G                               Dm
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                 Am                        C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                      G                         Dm
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
N.C.
I'm way too good at goodbyes

neon: `Well here is how I play "Neon" by John Mayer. Not the way I play it on electric.
I mainly play this on acoustic. But it can be played on electric this way. I'm
almost positive this is 100% right, then again I oculd be wrong. Either way enjoy!

(I)
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

(II)
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

(I)
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

(III)
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

(IV)
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
(V)
Who knows how long, how long, how long
(VI)
She can go before she burns away

(I)
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

(VII)
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

(IV)
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
(V)
Who knows how long, how long, how long
(VI)
She can go before she burns away

-then parts VIII and IX


There ya go! I included the lyrics as well as what parts to play where.
So i hope you have as much fun playin the song as I do!`,
